		\nThe last time that I had to take care of tourists again, it ended up incredibly wrong. One of the them ended up getting his face ripped apart after trying to pet a pseudodog. And I have no damn patience for this type of bullshit anymore, I'm telling you. I have even tried to convince Fanatic to do it for me, you know? He's always checking on everyone, trying his best to guide and help people. But he is aware that if something bad could happen to any tourist, Sidorovich begins to complain about how much we prejudice his pockets.\nDo me this favor, will you?

		<text>Do you see this list, stalker? These are the names of unwanted plotters, frauds, and slanderers - the kind of vermin I've had to deal with in the past. Many of them made the mistake of killing or robbing my couriers - or even harassing the tourists who pay me to get them into the Cordon, just to tarnish my image and business.\n \nIf you want the job, pick a name from the list, and I'll pass you their location.

	<string id="esc_m_trader_task_3_about">
		<text>Recently, some dandy bandit lord, up in Dark Valley, has decided to make another move on my business. He calls himself something stupid, like Sultana. What's next? Riesling? Muscadine?\n \nSo, let's send the bloated grape a message. Remind him who the real boss is. I know his men are skulking about - they usually make their way down to the Cordon through Darkscape or Meadow to harass the rookies and disrupt my routes. I'd like you to do me a favour and off a few of them. Then, bring me their %ses, and I'll sort out the rest.</text>
	</string>		
	<string id="esc_m_trader_task_3_fetch_about">
		<text>Yes, I've got a job that requires someone willing to get their hands dirty, hehe... If you have a gun and a steady aim - then you might find this job suitable. Bandits think they can show up here and mess with the local stalkers. They tend to prey on rookies, bleeding them dry and exploiting their lives just to make a quick buck.\n \nThere's no place for scum like that in the Cordon, understand? If you want to get yourself respected among loners, and also make some money - bring me a few bandit patches by putting some lowlife punks in the dirt.</text>
	</string>		
	<string id="esc_m_trader_task_3_fetch_finish">
		<text>That's my girl! This should teach these punks to think twice before messing with free stalkers. Keep up the rhythm, and you'll see how your name will be feared among them. Here's your reward - you've earned it, lass.</text>

		<text>This may be the border of the Zone, but even here, the rookies have it tough. Bandits are only half the problem - they at least understand Russian. But the mutants... that's a whole different story. If you're a skilled huntress, there's a mutant lair nearby that needs to be cleared. Normally, mutants don't settle in the Cordon - it's too quiet here - but when they do, they become a threat to anyone less experienced. Head out and make sure that lair's gone. The rookies will be relieved to know it's taken care of, do it for them and I'd owe you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_task_1_finish">
		<text>Thank you. This will make the rookies feel less hesitant. Hopefully, they'll take it as a chance to learn a thing or two before they end up as pig food. Ah, right... I said I'd owe you. Here's your payment.</text>

		<text>Another one of Sidorovich's new delivery men got caught up in trouble. Usually, this doesn't happen because the few couriers Sidorovich hires are well-experienced and know how to navigate without drawing too much attention, but this time it's different - a group of scoundrels is holding him, and they threaten to use the rookie as mutant food if we don't pay them.\n \nBut we don't trust scum like that to keep their word. We know his location, and I was tasked with organizing his retrieval. The only thing I'm missing is a competent fighter capable of freeing him from those brigands.\n \nWill you do it? The pay will be good, and people here will respect you for saving him. Otherwise, I'll have to go myself, and I don't want to leave the village half-guarded.</text>

But they'd rather kill you in cold blood than let you get out. So, my friends are stuck here.\n \nThe checkpoint guards won't let them through alive unless we bribe them with a Battery artefact. Have you heard of it? They can be found in Electro anomalies.\n \nIt's incredibly rare. I've already sent every stalker I can to find one, but no one has gotten back to me yet.
