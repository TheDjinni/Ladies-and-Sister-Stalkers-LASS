		<text>There's just nothing like the Zone, sis. Have you ever just seen the sky after an emission... the feeling of cool wind and a peace in the air... shit, I could write some poetry on that.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_363">
		<text>How about this for a story, sis: I was in the Red Forest because a friend of mine who had just quit the Zone left me coordinates for a stash of all his artefact-finding gear. I'm no blockhead, so I'm taking it real slow, observing first and then sneaking along. MY PDA led me up to a big tree; I walked around it and found my friend's pack in a huge fissure that ran down the trunk. I was just about to leave when I heard footsteps from the other side of the tree. I thought there were maybe five or six guys and they stopped moving for awhile so I snuck a peak around the side: a fucking squad of Monolith! So I just crouched there, behind the tree with half my body in the fissure. They didn't talk, but they did this weird sort of humming thing. Meanwhile, I'm thinking that it's all over for me; that they would notice me any second. I waited for six hours like that - imagine that! Then they left, and I hurried my lucky ass home.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_376">
		<text>Sis, just keep an eye out for new recruits doing anything fishy. Lukash says that Duty's trying to infiltrate us these days. Duty! Can you imagine some stuck-up army pissant trying to pass himself off as Freedom? Anyway, be on the lookout.</text>

	<string id="dm_information_391">
		<text>Hey sis, do you know Hawaiian? He told me to ask Free Stalkers if you knew about some guy named Degtyarev. Yeah, I don't know. Told him I'd do him a solid.</text>

		<text>I'm forever but a humble servant. You know, sister, I used to work as an engineer for the Masters even before the Zone was created. I was one of the many who assembled the venerable Generators, with no authority to speak of, and a small, but important role to play in the Zone's creation. When the Masters ascended to Vyraj and our Father, Chernobog, was let loose to carry out their will, he recruited me into the ranks of newborn Sin in recognition of my part in the mission and mechanical skills. Nowadays, I toil constantly to maintain the equipment of our crusaders in satisfactory condition, so that they can carry out the will of Masters as well.</text>

		<text>Pray with me sister! 
		\n\nBlessed is the man who walks not on the paths of the infidel, nor stands in the way of the sinner. But his delight is the glory of the Monolith alone, and his glory he contemplates day and night. He is like a cliff, planted in streams of water, a stronghold of faith. The infidels are not so, they are like chaff that the wind drives away. Therefore the infidel will not stand before you; no sinner will be in the congregation of your glory. For our Monolith knows the way of the righteous, but the ways of the infidel will perish.</text>
