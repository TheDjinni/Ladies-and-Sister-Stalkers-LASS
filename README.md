## Description

Ladies and Sister Stalkers (LASS) project is designed specifically for G.A.M.M.A. It replaces the player outfits and first person arms and legs with new female models, adds brand new player character voice acting with female English and Ukrainian voice actors, and overhauls the text dialogue to reflect female player.

Due to PaintThinner stepping back from modding, recent updates have been made by a small team of volunteers.

This mod is designed to supplement and improve upon [Warnymph](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph). You can always find the latest release from the the [github releases](https://github.com/Paint-Thinner/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS/releases) and install it by dragging it into MO2 at the bottom of the load order. If you find any bugs, with models etc. contact the community update team in the [original LASS thread in the GAMMA discord](https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1112579306309292072/1112579306309292072), or make a Github ticket.

## Installing in MO2

### Required

War Nymph (see above). Place above LASS in Mod Organizer 2.

LASS
-001 Sister of the Zone - Player leg and body models
-002 Arms of the Sister - Player arm and hand models
-003 Sounds of the Sister - Sounds and script files
-004A Voices of the Sister - Ukranian Player Voice
-004B Voices of the Sister - English Player Voice
-005 Dialogue of the Sister - Text edits for female player gender

Highly recommend checking all of the above, except choose either 004A (for Ukranian voice acting), or 004B (for English voice acting).

### Optional

Estradiol Valerate - Adds estrogen as a psyblock item
No muffled audio for masks - Self explanatory, the audio while wearing a mask is not muffled.
Paint's Black Fingernails - A small handful of outfits have open-fingered gloves, check this option if you want black-painted fingernails. Check the [LASS post on discord](https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1112579306309292072/1210386464769183775) for a guide on editing your fingernails to be whatever color or design you like.

DuxFortis whose models served the foundation of the mesh edits for this mod. Grok for providing a great STALKER experience I totally cut up and butchered to work, and Obsidian because I totally yoinked a few assets from Kotor 2.
