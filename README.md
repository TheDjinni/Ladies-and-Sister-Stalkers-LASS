## Description

Ladies and Sister Stalkers (LASS) project is designed specifically for [Stalker G.A.M.M.A.](https://discord.gg/8vpwpfdBUc) (no support is available for non-GAMMA installs at this time). It replaces the player outfits and first person arms and legs with new female models, adds brand new player character voice acting with female English and Ukrainian voice actors, and overhauls the text dialogue to reflect the fact that the player is female.

Due to PaintThinner stepping back from modding, recent updates have been made by a small team of volunteers.

This mod is designed to supplement and improve upon [Warnymph](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph). You can always find the latest release from the the [github releases](https://github.com/Paint-Thinner/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS/releases) and install it by dragging it into MO2 at the bottom of the load order. If you find any bugs, with models etc. contact the community update team in the [original LASS thread in the GAMMA discord](https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1112579306309292072/1112579306309292072), or make a Github ticket.

## Installing in MO2

To install mods to GAMMA, simply open up Mod Organizer 2 and hit ctrl+m on your keyboard, then select the zip file of the mod you want to install.

### Required

<ol><li><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph">War nymph</a>. Use <i>default installation</i> (modules 001, 002, and 003) only</i>, attempts to install alternate modules are not guaranteed to work. Lass builds upon and overwrites a large chunk of War Nymph anyways so its unlikely that whatever options you pick will be carried over (e.g. removing gloves from outfits). Install via Mod Organizer 2 as per above, and place above LASS in Mod Organizer 2.</li>
<li>LASS; download "Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS.zip" from the <a href="https://github.com/TheDjinni/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS/releases">latest release</a>. Install via MO2 as per above and check the modules you would like. Ensure LASS is below War Nymph.</li></ol>

That's it, nothing else is required. If you got here via the GAMMA discord and you've seen other required files or assets being recommended, it's <i>probably</i> old news and you don't need them.

LASS contains the following modules:

<ul><li>001 Sister of the Zone - Player leg and body models</li><li>002 Arms of the Sister - Player arm and hand models</li><li>003 Sounds of the Sister - Sounds and script files</li><li>004A Voices of the Sister - Ukranian Player Voice</li><li>004B Voices of the Sister - English Player Voice</li><li>005 Dialogue of the Sister - Text edits for female player gender</li><li>006 Portraits of the Sister - Animated female portraits</li></ul>

Highly recommend checking all of the above, except choose either 004A (for Ukranian voice acting), or 004B (for English voice acting). Note that if anyone would like to contribute text edits for languages other than English, please contact TheDjinni in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1112579306309292072/1112579306309292072">LASS thread in the GAMMA discord</a>.

### Optional

<ul><li>Estradiol Valerate - Adds estrogen as a psyblock item</li><li>No muffled audio for masks - Self explanatory, the audio while wearing a mask is not muffled</li><li>Paint's Black Fingernails - Some outfits have open-fingered gloves, check this option if you want black-painted fingernails. Check the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1112579306309292072/1210386464769183775">pinned messages in the LASS thread of the GAMMA discord</a> for a guide on manually editing your fingernails/hand textures to be whatever color or design you like.</li></ul>
