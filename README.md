## Description

Ladies and Sister Stalkers (LASS) project is designed specifically for [Stalker G.A.M.M.A.](https://discord.gg/8vpwpfdBUc) (no support is available for non-GAMMA installs at this time). It replaces the player outfits and first person arms and legs with new female models, adds brand new player character voice acting with female English and Ukrainian voice actors, and overhauls the text dialogue to reflect the fact that the player is female.

Due to PaintThinner stepping back from modding, recent updates have been made by a small team of volunteers.

This mod is designed to supplement and improve upon [Warnymph](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph). You can always find the latest release from the the [github releases](https://github.com/Paint-Thinner/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS/releases) and install it by dragging it into MO2 at the bottom of the load order. If you find any bugs, with models etc. contact the community update team in the [original LASS thread in the GAMMA discord](https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1112579306309292072/1112579306309292072), or make a Github ticket.

## Installing in MO2

To install mods to GAMMA, simply open up Mod Organizer 2 and hit ctrl+m on your keyboard, then select the zip file of the mod you want to install.

### Required

<ol><li><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph">War nymph</a>. Install as per above. Place above LASS in Mod Organizer 2.</li>
<li>LASS; download "Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS.zip" from the <a href="https://github.com/TheDjinni/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS/releases">latest release</a>. Install as per above. Ensure LASS is below War Nymph.</li>

That's it, nothing else is required. If you got here via the GAMMA discord and you've seen other required files or assets being recommended, it's <i>probably</i> old news and you don't need them.

LASS contains the following modules:

<ul><li>001 Sister of the Zone - Player leg and body models</li><li>002 Arms of the Sister - Player arm and hand models</li><li>003 Sounds of the Sister - Sounds and script files</li><li>004A Voices of the Sister - Ukranian Player Voice</li><li>004B Voices of the Sister - English Player Voice</li><li>005 Dialogue of the Sister - Text edits for female player gender</li></ul>

Highly recommend checking all of the above, except choose either 004A (for Ukranian voice acting), or 004B (for English voice acting).

### Optional

<ul><li>Estradiol Valerate - Adds estrogen as a psyblock item</li><li>No muffled audio for masks - Self explanatory, the audio while wearing a mask is not muffled</li><li>Paint's Black Fingernails - A small handful of outfits have open-fingered gloves, check this option if you want black-painted fingernails. Check the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/912320241713958912/1112579306309292072/1210386464769183775">pinned messages in the LASS thread of the GAMMA discord</a> for a guide on editing your fingernails to be whatever color or design you like.</li></ul>

PaintThinner for the tireless effort creating the original mod. [Cressida's ACTUAL Female Player Character mod](https://github.com/CressidaIlliana/jubilant-octo-garbanzo) which served the basis for this project. DuxFortis whose models served the foundation of the mesh edits for this mod. Grok for providing a great STALKER experience I totally cut up and butchered to work, and Obsidian because I totally yoinked a few assets from Kotor 2.

The great voice acting provided by [Tetiana Voloshyna](https://voice123.com/voice-actor/tetjanavoloshina1996) and [Julia Walker](https://www.voplanet.com/julia-walker) for the player dialogue.
